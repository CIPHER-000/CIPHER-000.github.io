# CS50 MEET
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

      Hello and this is my **CS50 final project** which I am going to cover in details, explaining the idea behind the project and how it will change the way you take the CS50 course online/in-person. If you are taking the Harvard CS50 course and you feel like you're alone, you don't have any friends to connect and take the course 
with, well CS50 MEET is here for you. 
  
  ### THE GOAL
      The goal of this project is to bring all CS50 students together to connect, make friends, socailize and really help eachother throughout the course especially for those who are in different parts of the world who might feel alone and really don't have anyone to talk to. This helps to cancel out the possibility of not being able to socailize well with other course mates.
      I see this as a journey not one person can take alone, for "no one is an island" as the famous quote says, plus we operate at our best when we work together. So you need others with you on this journey.
      While I was taking the course myself, I took it alone but it would have been better if I had someone to explain all my problems to concerning the course projects and lectures, you know to really brain-storm and get things right with the help of another, I know I didn't build this entire project on my own(if I did, I wouldn't have gotten this far honestly), but with the help of my friend(who is not a CS50 student), I was able to learn alot from him and implement some new ideas into my project and only then did it get really fun, LOL. So I hope to change that by the implementation of this Project and I hope it does change.
  
So all that being said, let me explain what each pages on the web-app do.
      
  ### firstpage
      The first page/route on the webpage is called "firstpage", in the HTML file, it's called "firstpage.html". I named it that because it's the first page you'll see whrn you type in the project's url.
      This page contains a summary of what CS50 MEET is and what it does for those who are just logging in for the first time. Underneath the summary, there's a button there that says "JOIN", clicking that button would redirect you to the second page/route called "login_register".
      
  ### login_register
      This page as the names states, contains the login and the register forms which will be required in order to log into your account or if you're just joining, to register you into the database. This page contains a bit of Javascript code which is used to make the cool effect of switching between the login and the register form.
After a new user registers him/herself in the database, an instant redirect occurs which redirects you to a new page/route called "hobbies"
  
  ### hobbies
      This page/route was supposed to be called "personality" (because it contains a list of different traits and personalities of a person), but it was too long, I just wanted to shorten things out, so don't mistake things here, those are personality traits not hobbies.
      So this page contains 30 personality traits questions with levels to which are true about you, ("Totally Agree", "Somewhat Agree", "Neutral", "Somewhat Disagree" and "Totally Disagree"). So you'd pick answer each question according to the levels stated just now. After you answer every questions, click the "next" button below the page and you'll be redirected instantly to a new page/route called "interests". NOTE: the questions in the page are tested and proven questions gotten from trusted sources.

  ### interests
