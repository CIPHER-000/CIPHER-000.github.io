# CS50 MEET
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

      Hello and this is my **CS50 final project** which I am going to cover in details, explaining the idea behind the project and how it will change the way you take the CS50 course online/in-person. If you are taking the Harvard CS50 course and you feel like you're alone, you don't have any friends to connect and take the course 
with, well CS50 MEET is here for you. 
  
  ### THE GOAL
      The goal of this project is to bring all CS50 students together to connect, make friends, socailize and really help eachother throughout the course especially for those who are in different parts of the world who might feel alone and really don't have anyone to talk to. This helps to cancel out the possibility of not being able to socailize well with other course mates.
      I see this as a journey not one person can take alone, for "no one is an island" as the famous quote says, plus we operate at our best when we work together. So you need others with you on this journey.
      While I was taking the course myself, I took it alone but it would have been better if I had someone to explain all my problems to concerning the course projects and lectures, you know to really brain-storm and get things right with the help of another, I know I didn't build this entire project on my own(if I did, I wouldn't have gotten this far honestly), but with the help of my friend(who is not a CS50 student), I was able to learn alot from him and implement some new ideas into my project and only then did it get really fun, LOL. So I hope to change that by the implementation of this Project and I hope it does change.
  
So all that being said, let me explain what each pages on the web-app do.
